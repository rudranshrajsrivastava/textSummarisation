text="""The number 1/3 expressed as a decimal (0.333333...) cannot be summarized further, as it is an infinitely repeating decimal. The digits 3 continue forever without any pattern change or termination.
Similarly, the mathematical constant Ï€ (3.14159...) cannot be condensed, as it is an irrational number that continues infinitely without repeating patterns.
Another example is a single character or letter - it represents the smallest unit of written text and cannot be reduced further while maintaining meaning.."""
